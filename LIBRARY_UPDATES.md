### Build Results

âœ… **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** - All modules compiled successfully

- Total build time: ~20 minutes
- 305 actionable tasks: 146 executed, 7 from cache, 152 up-to-date

### Code Changes

1. **App.kt** - Commented out reference to non-existent `SpiralAnimationView()` component
    - Added TODO comment to implement this component in the future

### Compatibility Notes

- All updated libraries are compatible with each other
- Kotlin 2.1.21 is compatible with:
    - Compose Multiplatform 1.7.3
    - KSP 2.1.21-2.0.1
    - AGP 8.8.2
    - Gradle 8.13

### Known Issues Resolved

1. **KSP Version Mismatch** - Initially tried KSP 2.1.21-1.0.30 which doesn't exist. Corrected to 2.1.21-2.0.1
2. **AndroidX Lifecycle Version** - Version 2.8.7 is not available for Compose Multiplatform, using 2.8.3 instead
3. **Missing Component** - Commented out non-existent `SpiralAnimationView` to allow successful build

### Next Steps

- Consider implementing the `SpiralAnimationView` component
- Monitor for newer versions of Compose Multiplatform (check for 1.8.x releases)
- Keep an eye on Kotlin updates (2.2.x series is in development)

### Testing Recommendations

1. Test all existing functionality to ensure backward compatibility
2. Test on all target platforms (Android, iOS, Desktop, Web)
3. Verify that all features work as expected with the updated libraries
